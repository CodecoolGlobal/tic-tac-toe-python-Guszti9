It started as a Tic Tac Toe game, but I improve it to Gomoku, and implement an Ai to it.
Tic-tac-toe is the old version it do not use classes and its Ai work different from the new one.
The new Gomoku game main python file is Gomoku.py in OP_gomoku. It uses Pattern recognition for its ai, the pattern are in the PatternRecogniser class.
It can use Minimax algorythm too, but it slows it down, and it is still beatable.

Usage

- you can execute python3 Gomoku.py command in terminal to start the new version if you are staying at the OP_gomoku file
- you can execute python3 tic-tac-toe.py command in terminal to start the old version python3
